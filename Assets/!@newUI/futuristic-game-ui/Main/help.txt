frames (Circular graphic placed in the layer named "frame") provided in some of the files are to keep your game icons inside, for an example you can keep the icon of a spaceship in the frame of the space ship selection file 

Perspective infographics are smart objects, that you can click on the smart object icon and edit the .psb file.

Transparent png files of the ui elements are also provided
